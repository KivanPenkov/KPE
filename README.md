Hi there,

I am thinking of testing a voting system in a specific order for my company to vote for or against certain "policies" or principles we have adopted. I am not an expert machine learner myself but I would like to build a model accomplishing the following:

The system should be designed to go ahead with complex decision making, that requires heavy thought input, or addressing controversial topics that might be sensitive for organisations to handle. The system in python should be built as follows

- Each individual user input will be having the chance to vote for or against a cause or business decision.

There needs to be a minimum of 10 participants.

If the system is successful it will ideally be scaled to 1000s of employee,s only continuing until 100% consensus has been achieved internally.
